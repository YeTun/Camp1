      The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport,
      etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most
      common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive
      translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If
      several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual
      languages. The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will be as
      simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To an English person, it will seem like simplified English, as a
      skeptical Cambridge friend of mine told me what Occidental is.The European languages are members of the same family.

      The quick, brown fox jumps over a lazy dog. DJs flock by when MTV ax quiz prog. Junk MTV quiz graced by fox whelps.
      Bawds jog, flick quartz, vex nymphs. Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex! Fox nymphs grab quick-jived waltz. Brick quiz
      whangs jumpy veldt fox. Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack. Quick wafting zephyrs vex bold Jim. Quick zephyrs blow,
      vexing daft Jim. Sex-charged fop blew my junk TV quiz. How quickly daft jumping zebras vex. Two driven jocks help fax my
      big quiz. Quick, Baz, get my woven flax jodhpurs! "Now fax quiz Jack!" my brave ghost pled. Five quacking zephyrs jolt
      my wax bed. Flummoxed by job, kvetching W. zaps Iraq. Cozy sphinx waves quart jug of bad milk. A very bad quack might
      jinx zippy fowls. Few quips galvanized the mock jury box. Quick brown dogs jump over the lazy fox. The jay, pig, fox,
      zebra, and my wolves quack! Blowzy red vixens fight for a quick jump. Joaquin Phoenix was gazed by MTV for luck. A
      wizardâ€™s job is to vex chumps quickly in fog. Watch "Jeopardy!", Alex Trebek's fun TV quiz game. Woven silk pyjamas
      exchanged for blue quartz.
